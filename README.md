# Aurora RAT

## About

Aurora RAT or Remote Administration Tool is written in Go, using wxGo as a GUI toolkit.

This project was started to learn networking in go and get myself started in the security field.

## External Libraries Required

[wxGo](https://github.com/dontpanic92/wxGo)

## Notice

Currently dropping GUI support in favor or simplicity. A GUI will be added when Aurora itself is more fledged out.
